## Instructions
1. To prepare your noodles from frozen, soak them in hot water for about a minute, and use a pair of chopsticks to carefully loosen the noodles. Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.
2. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, and add pork belly. Fry both sides until golden brown, add onion and green onion, and cook until aromatic.
3. Add kimchi and sugar and cook until the kimchi is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add gochugaru, oyster sauce, kimchi juice, and water, mix to combine, and cook for an additional minute until the sauce is slightly thickened.
4. Add udon noodles and toss together until the noodles are evenly coated. Season with salt if needed, and add sesame oil to finish. Garnish and enjoy!
